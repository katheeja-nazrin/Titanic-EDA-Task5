Titanic EDA – Task 5

This project is part of **Task 5** in my coursework, focusing on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using the Titanic dataset from Kaggle.  
The goal is to explore the dataset, identify key patterns, and visualize survival trends.

Analysis Overview
1. Data Loading & Exploration: 
   - Loaded Titanic dataset.  
   - Checked data structure, missing values, and statistics.  

2. Data Cleaning:  
   - Identified and noted missing values.  
   - Basic formatting for analysis.  

3. Visualizations:  
   Created with "Matplotlib and Seaborn"
   - Age distribution  
   - Survival count by gender  
   - Age by passenger class  
   - Correlation heatmap  
   - Fare vs Age colored by survival  

4. Observations & Insights:
   - Females had a higher survival rate than males.  
   - First-class passengers survived more often.  
   - Younger passengers had better chances of survival.  
   - Higher ticket fares correlated with survival.
